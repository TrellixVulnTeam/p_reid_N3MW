Implementation for CVPR 2017 Paper: "AlignedReID: Surpassing Human-level Performance in Person Re-Identification" by pytorch.


Thanks for [huanghoujing's AlignedReID-Re-Production-Pytorch](https://github.com/huanghoujing/AlignedReID-Re-Production-Pytorch), I completed the Implementation of the paper. I rewrited some codes for easier understanding for myself, and there are many similarities in the repository with huanghoujing's.
